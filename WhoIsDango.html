        <h1>Daniël Górski, a.k.a Dango</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm a DJ, music-producer from Tilburg, Netherlands and have publicly started DJing since the 11th of February 2023. 
            I got my first dj controller on the 24th of December 2022, I wanted it for christmas, how this begun, not sure, I think it's from the influence from Daft Punk
        as I am a huge fan, I looked into some files and found that I have been wanting the DJ Controller since like Oct-Nov 2022. 
        I have started music produciton on the 6th of August 2022</p>
