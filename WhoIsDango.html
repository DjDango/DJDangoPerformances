        <h1>Daniël Górski, a.k.a Dango</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm a DJ, music-producer from Tilburg, Netherlands and have publicly started DJing since the 11th of February 2023. 
            I got my first dj controller on the 24th of December 2022, I wanted it for christmas, how this begun, not sure, I think it's from the influence from Daft Punk
        as I am a huge fan, I looked into some files and found that I have been wanting the DJ Controller since like Oct-Nov 2022. 
        I have started music production on the 6th of August 2022. 
        
        On the 1st of June 2020 for kid day, I got a Casio LK-135, a keyboard on which I started experimenting with different loops,
        I made these mini concerts in my bedroom where my little brother and mum would listen, this was around August 2020, I even titled the so called 'songs', I wrote it down on paper, but 1 day
        I had to clean up my papers since I had a lot & I think that I threw it away, I wish I hadn't, but I do remember there were like about 9-12 songs on the paper, one of them even having a 10 day anniversary
        version for the 1st song.</p>
