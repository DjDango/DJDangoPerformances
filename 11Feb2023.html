    <h1>11th of February 2023</h1>
    <h2>Basisschool Antares, Tilburg</h2>
    <p>This was my 1st ever DJ Performance, I think one of the teachers asked me to play, it was a kids carnival event in my polish school, as it was very new for me to play publically, I didn't have smooth techniques,
    but I mixed some enjoyable music anyways so I think it was atleast a little okay. I dressed up as mickey mouse, I brought my mouse, mousepad, I didn't even have my dj-headphones yet, I had borrowed them from my uncle
    <p><a href='https://andrewcoremusic.com/'>which goes by the DJ name Andrew Core.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>Here are the 1st pictures ever of my 1st performance</p>
